# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide feedback and direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline, or if you have to change some things later.

### Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide a means by which police dogs, left in cars while their handlers attend to business, have a method by which alerts may be sent out should the temperature rise to unsafe levels for the dogs.  Since the dogs cannot call for help themselves, the system must rely on a sensor, which should be small enough and mobile enough to be placed on the dog itself.  I'm envisioning a special dog tag, or a special device fitted to the dog's police harness.

There's two key points to this technology.  The first is, that action is sensor-based, since dogs cannot use technology to call for help themselves.  There can be no "keyboard" input; input must come from the temperature sensor.  The second is redundancy.  Alerts should go out to at least two different kinds of channels, for safety purposes.  If one channel fails, the alert can get through the other channel.  Of necessity, the two channels must employ different technologies.
### Features
Sensor-based input.
SMS based notification for mobile phones.
Web notification for browsers.   
### Technologies
C# (Chosen because most government agencies will use .Net rather than Python)
Raspberry Pi or Sparkfun motherboard
Wireless connections
SMS Notification
Web Notification 

### What I'll Have to Learn
How to program a Rasberry Pi or Sparkfun motherboard
How to connect using a wireless network
How to send SMS using C# ( and possibly/probably .net)
How to send web notifications using C#
